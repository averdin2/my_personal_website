        <p>
          Since a young age, I have been fascinated by the capabilities of
          computers and the power of programming. After diving into my first
          hello world app, I have thoroughly come to enjoy the challenges and
          creativity that comes with software development. I am a Front-End web
          developer with a passion for web design and user experience. I am
          primarily focused on making responsive React web applications, but I
          like to dabble in various other web technologies when I get the
          chance. I am always seeking ways to improve my skills and learn
          something new. If you would like to contact me, feel free to message
          me on LinkedIn.
