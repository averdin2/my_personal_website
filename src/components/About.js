        <p>
        Since a young age, I have been fascinated by the capabilities of computers and the power of programming. After diving into my first hello world app, I have thoroughly come to enjoy the challenges and creativity that comes with software development. I am passionate about my work and I strive to see the projects I am a part of succeed. I prioritize sound judgement, integrity, and quality work in everything that I do. I am constantly seeking to improve my skills and learn new technologies in this ever-changing landscape. When I am not coding, I enjoy watching Dodgers games or mixing myself a drink and listening to the latest “Front End Happy Hour” podcast. For any inquiries feel free to shoot me an email or message me on LinkedIn.
